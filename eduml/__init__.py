Educational Machine Learning (EML) module for Python
==================================
edu-machine-learning is a Python module integrating classical machine
learning algorithms - covered in the course Machine Learning as part 
of the BSc Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen.

The module aims to maximise understandability with the goal to be
educationally valuable and aid the teaching in undergraduate level
courses machine learning courses. It's goals is explicitely not to 
maximise ease of maintenance, code reuse or algorithmic performance.

For these purposes, other machine learning libraries and frameworks, 
as noted in the README are recommendend.
